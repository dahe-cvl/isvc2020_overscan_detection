Dataset: 



Pre-Trained models:


Run Training: 

    to start the training process the following commands are needed:
    python segmentation_train.py -m <SELECT_MODE> [optional: -c <PATH_TO_CONFIG>]
    
    e.g. 
    --> start training with single configuration file (.json see ./config folder)
    python segmentation_train.py -m train_single -c ./config/debug/train_exp_debug.json

    --> start training on multiple configuration files (.json see ./config folder)
    python segmentation_train.py -m train_multiple 
    Hint: change configuration path in method trainMultipleExp(...)
    
    --> start evaluation of single experiment (experiment folder includes experiment_notes.json, best_model.pth and loss_history.log)
    python segmentation_train.py -m train_single -c ./config/debug/train_exp_debug.json
    
    --> start evaluation on multiple experiments 
    python segmentation_train.py -m test_multiple 
    Hint: change results path in method runMultipleTests(...)


Run Inference:

    to run the a pre-trained model in inference mode the following commands are needed:
    python segmentation_inference.py
    
    e.g. 
    --> start training with single configuration file (.json see ./config folder)
    python segmentation_train.py -m train_single -c ./config/debug/train_exp_debug.json

    --> start training on multiple configuration files (.json see ./config folder)
    python segmentation_train.py -m train_multiple 
    Hint: change configuration path in method trainMultipleExp(...)
